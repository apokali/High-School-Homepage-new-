                        Are you still thinking about how happy you were at the winter term? Here is a quick reminer that it is almost over. Recall that at the end of last term, the Student Union has decided to initiate a whole new activity i.e. the micro movie competition, which was a big topic around the campus. Today the Public Relations Department has decided to get closer to the four teams and they are gonna respond how well they prepared for this event.

                    <p class="script">
                        This first team is from A2-2 class and the direcor is Cindy, who also talently directed the movie from the exchange program in the UK.<br><br>
                        <b>Aileen:</b> What is your movie about for this competition?<br>
                        <b>Cindy:</b> I'm so glad I can share my ideas via this. It's basically about the simple life happened in my class every day including all of my best friends.<br>
                        <b>Aileen:</b> Do you think you're gonna win this competition? Since last time you did a really great job and almost everyone was impressed by your work, also was I!<br>
                        <b>Cindy:</b> I have got a hunch on it... well, we'll see what happened.. I even made a trailer for it to attract more potential votes on the final voting round.<br>
                        <b>Aileen:</b> Sure you will nail it ! I'm really looking forward to seeing you final "product" shown in front of the public! Again, congrats for your win on last competition.
